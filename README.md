# Explanation:

Prompt Engineering allows us to design effective queries that guide AI systems to produce meaningful, context-aware responses.
In this experiment, the manufacturing automation use case is considered from Unit 5. AI with IoT and embedded controllers is applied to improve monitoring, predictive maintenance, and energy efficiency.

# Scenario:
The manufacturing industry seeks to automate monitoring and optimize efficiency using IoT devices and embedded controllers. AI will enable predictive maintenance, reduce downtime, and enhance energy management.

Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies in automotive, electronics, and food processing sectors.

# Objectives:

Improve production efficiency by 30%

Minimize machinery downtime using predictive maintenance

Enable real-time monitoring and remote control

Reduce energy usage with process optimization

# Prompt Types with Examples
1. Comparative Analysis Prompt

Definition: Compares two or more concepts, focusing on differences and similarities.

# Prompt Example:
“Compare and contrast predictive maintenance with traditional scheduled maintenance in manufacturing systems.”

Sample Response:
Predictive maintenance uses AI and IoT to detect potential failures in advance, reducing downtime and saving costs. Traditional scheduled maintenance relies on fixed time intervals, which can lead to unnecessary servicing or unexpected breakdowns.

2. Experiential Perspective Prompt

Definition: Generates responses from a particular role or viewpoint.

Prompt Example:
“As a factory manager, explain the benefits of AI-based predictive maintenance.”

Sample Response:
“As a factory manager, AI-based predictive maintenance helps me avoid unexpected equipment failures, plan service schedules effectively, and reduce costs associated with machine downtime.”

3. Everyday Functioning Prompt

Definition: Shows how concepts are applied in daily operations or common activities.

Prompt Example:
“How is IoT-based monitoring in factories similar to health monitoring apps on smartphones?”

Sample Response:
IoT monitoring in factories works like health apps: sensors continuously track machine performance (like heart rate), send alerts when values are abnormal, and provide long-term data for optimization.

4. Universal Prompt Structures

Definition: General-purpose templates adaptable to various contexts.

Prompt Example 1:
“Explain predictive maintenance in simple terms with an example.”

Response:
Predictive maintenance means checking machines regularly using sensors and AI to predict failures before they happen. Example: A motor that vibrates unusually alerts engineers to service it before it breaks.

Prompt Example 2:
“Explain the process of automating a factory step by step.”

# Response:

Install IoT sensors on machines.

Collect real-time performance data.

Analyze data with AI models.

Predict possible failures.

Automate alerts and control responses.

5. Prompt Size Limitations

Definition: Managing very large tasks by breaking them into smaller prompts.

Prompt Example:
“List 50 ways AI can improve manufacturing efficiency.”

Refined Prompt:
“List 10 ways AI can improve manufacturing efficiency. Continue until 50 are listed.”

Sample Response (first 5):

Real-time monitoring of machine health

Predictive maintenance scheduling

Energy consumption optimization

Automated quality inspection

Production line optimization

Evaluation (Rubric Method):
Criteria	Score (1–5)	Remarks
Clarity of Response	5	Responses were clear and well-structured
Relevance to Scenario	5	All responses matched the manufacturing case
Practical Application	4	Most responses applicable in real-world use
Conversational Quality	4	Some prompts felt slightly formal

Overall Score: 18/20 – The prompts were effective and scenario-focused.

### Conclusion:

The various prompt types (Comparative Analysis, Experiential Perspective, Everyday Functioning, Universal Structures, and Prompt Size Limitations) were applied successfully to the manufacturing automation scenario. Each method demonstrated unique strengths in generating accurate and context-aware responses.

### Result:

Thus, the prompts were executed successfully, evaluated using rubrics, and the report was generated.
